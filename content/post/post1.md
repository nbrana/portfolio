This spring, I competed in the **National Cyber League (NCL) Spring 2025 Game**, one of the most well-regarded cybersecurity competitions for students in the U.S.

I'm proud to share that I placed in the **95th percentile** nationally — a reflection of the time, effort, and strategic thinking I’ve developed over the past year.

### About the Competition

The NCL is a biannual cybersecurity competition that tests a wide range of skills, including:

- Cryptography  
- Web Application Exploitation  
- Network Traffic Analysis  
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)  
- Password Cracking  
- Log Analysis  
- Forensics  

Participants are challenged to apply both technical knowledge and problem-solving skills in real-world scenarios.

### My Strategy

Some highlights from my approach included:

- Using custom wordlists with **Hashcat** to optimize password cracking  
- Leveraging **Wireshark** and **tshark** filters to isolate credential leakage in PCAPs  
- Practicing recon and enumeration techniques from past games and CTF challenges  
- Automating OSINT flag searches through scripting and careful pattern recognition  

### Reflection

Competing in the NCL Spring Game has been an incredibly rewarding experience. The challenges pushed me to improve my skills across a broad set of cybersecurity domains, and the percentile ranking is a major personal milestone.

If you're a student interested in cybersecurity, I highly recommend participating in the NCL. It’s a great way to test your skills, learn new tools, and connect with a national community of cybersecurity enthusiasts.
