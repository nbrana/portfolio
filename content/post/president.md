I was recently elected to serve as the President of the Fordham Cybersecurity Club. I was previously serving as Vice President, under the leadership of Laura Suarez, M.S. Cybersecurity Class of '25. As an ISACA affiliated club, I am exceted to work with our partners and put on events, and workshops, and lead our University in CTF competitions.

### Planned Events

My goal is to increase club participation and membership within the Fall semester, with the goal of training and leading a team to participate in CTF competitions like the National Cyber League. I am hoping to host more jeopardy style CTF's to introduce undergraduate students to the concept and format of CTF's and how to complete these challenges.

Towards the end of the Fall semester, I am working on hosting a networking event featuring faculty, students, and alumni. This should give the students an opportunity to learn more about the roles available within cybersecurity and connect with industry professionals.

### After Graduation

The ultimate goal is to leave the club in a strong position to host events, and compete on the national scale with other universities. I would like to play a role in raising the stature of Fordham University in the cybersecurity community.
