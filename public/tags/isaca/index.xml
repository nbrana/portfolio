      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently elected to serve as the President of the Fordham Cybersecurity Club. I was previously serving as Vice President, under the leadership of Laura Suarez, M.S. Cybersecurity Class of &amp;lsquo;25. As an ISACA affiliated club, I am exceted to work with our partners and put on events, and workshops, and lead our University in CTF competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;planned-events&#34;&gt;Planned Events&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My goal is to increase club participation and membership within the Fall semester, with the goal of training and leading a team to participate in CTF competitions like the National Cyber League. I am hoping to host more jeopardy style CTF&amp;rsquo;s to introduce undergraduate students to the concept and format of CTF&amp;rsquo;s and how to complete these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
